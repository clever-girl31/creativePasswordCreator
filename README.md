# Creative Password Creator

## Description

The Creative Password Creator project was undertaken to fill a growing gap in the market, and to the respond to the rising sentiment which is encapsulated in the phrase, "We have straight up run out of passwords." So stop adding an additional character to the end the password you have been using since the days of 512mb flash drives, and give Creative Password Creator a whirl.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
